# ArduinoSmartStick
A smart stick that can help the blind walk without others help.

It users a ultrasonic sensor and a ir sensor to sense the distance between the obstacle and the stick.
We set a threshold distace after which the buzzer rings and the person can understand there is an obstacle infront.
